# Single-Cell-Data-Analysis-Tutorial

Overview
This project provides a complete pipeline for Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Analysis, including preprocessing, clustering, dimensionality reduction, cell type annotation, differential expression analysis, and visualization. This tutorial is structured to provide a reproducible workflow that can be deployed to GitHub.

Objectives
- Perform quality control and preprocessing of scRNA-Seq data.
- Apply clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.
- Annotate cell types using known markers.
- Perform differential expression analysis.
- Visualize the results through various plots.


ðŸ“š Tools and Packages
R Packages: Seurat, dplyr, ggplot2, patchwork, GEOquery, BiocManager, readr, tibble


ðŸ“Š Dataset
A publicly available single-cell RNA-Seq dataset is used, downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.
Replace the geo_id in the script with your desired dataset.

Workflow
1. Data Acquisition
2. Preprocessing
3. Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
4. Cell Type Annotation
6. Differential Expression Analysis
8. Visualization
